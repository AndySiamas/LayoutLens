THU FEB 19 (PST)
Goal for today: “Prompt → runs/room_plan.json (always) → Unreal loads + spawns placeholders (at least once)”

1:43 PM – 2:00 PM   Quick reset + set the ONE success criteria
                    - Write it down: “I can generate runs/room_plan.json and Unreal imports it.”

2:00 PM – 3:15 PM   Repo + project structure (fast + minimal)
                    - Create official hackathon repo folder (don’t overthink naming)
                    - Move pydantic_experiment into /python (or /backend)
                    - Add /unreal folder placeholder (empty is fine for now)
                    - Add .gitignore (ignore runs/, .env, __pycache__, etc.)
                    - Add .env.example (LLM_BASE_URL, LLM_MODEL, ROOM_GRID_SIZE, RUNS_DIR)
                    - Commit: “Scaffold repo + env + runs dir”

3:15 PM – 3:25 PM   Short break

3:25 PM – 4:45 PM   Pipeline reliability: ALWAYS produce a final RoomPlan JSON
                    - Ensure Settings has runs_dir_path
                    - On every run: clear runs dir, then write:
                      - runs/design.json
                      - runs/space.json
                      - runs/room_plan_candidate.json (last parsed attempt)
                      - runs/room_plan.json (final output: valid if possible, repaired if needed)
                      - runs/validation_error.txt (if any)
                    - Confirm: RepairAgent triggers ONLY after retries are exhausted
                    - Test 2 prompts:
                      - garden shed
                      - small coffee shop
                    - Definition of “pass”: room_plan.json exists every run

4:45 PM – 5:00 PM   Break + small snack / short walk

5:00 PM – 6:30 PM   Unreal Visualizer: bare minimum import + spawn
                    - Create UE project (blank)
                    - Add a Blueprint Actor “BP_LayoutLoader”
                    - Load JSON from absolute path pointing to runs/room_plan.json (hardcode for now)
                    - Spawn cubes for FLOOR elements:
                      - scale X/Y from footprint width/depth
                      - set location from transform x/y (Z = 0)
                    - Optional if quick: TextRender above cube with label

6:30 PM – 7:15 PM   Dinner

7:15 PM – 8:30 PM   End-to-end integration (the demo loop)
                    - Run python → confirm runs/room_plan.json updates
                    - In Unreal: hit Play → loader reads JSON → cubes appear
                    - Fix obvious coordinate issues only (swap axes if needed, scale factor if needed)
                    - Add a simple “Reload” key press (R) if easy; otherwise restart PIE

8:30 PM – 9:15 PM   Demo prep (lightweight)
                    - Pick 2 prompts that look decent (shed + coffee shop)
                    - Do 1 dry run recording: terminal run + Unreal import + quick fly around
                    - Save 2 screenshots for README

9:15 PM – 10:00 PM  README skeleton + commit
                    - README sections:
                      - What it does (1 paragraph)
                      - Architecture (DesignAgent → SpaceAgent → RoomPlanAgent → RepairAgent → Unreal)
                      - How to run (python + Unreal)
                      - Limitations (overlaps → repair may delete items)
                    - Commit: “Demo loop working + README skeleton”


FRI FEB 20 (PST) — FINISH + SUBMIT (MORNING BUFFER)
Goal for Friday: “Polish + record final 2–3 min demo + submit”

7:30 AM – 8:30 AM   Final reliability pass (no heroics)
                    - Fresh run from clean repo checkout works
                    - runs/ outputs appear correctly
                    - Unreal loads without manual JSON edits

8:30 AM – 9:15 AM   Final video capture
                    - Keep it short: show 2 prompts max
                    - Show: prompt → generated JSON → Unreal spawns layout
                    - Export video + verify audio/screen readable

9:15 AM – 9:40 AM   README finalize + repo polish
                    - Clear setup steps
                    - Add demo instructions + video link
                    - Ensure .env not committed, runs/ ignored, no huge files

9:40 AM – 10:00 AM  Submission buffer
                    - Last checks: repo public, README good, video link works
                    - Submit


NOTES (TO STAY ON TRACK)
- If something takes >30 minutes and isn’t “demo loop”, cut it.
- Today’s win is ONE working end-to-end import in Unreal. Everything else is bonus.
